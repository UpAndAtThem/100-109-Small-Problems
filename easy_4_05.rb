# Write a method that searches for all multiples of 3 or 5 that lie between 1 and some other number, and then computes the sum of those multiples. For instance, if the supplied number is 20, the result should be 98 (3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18 + 20).

# You may assume that the number passed in is an integer greater than 1.
count = 0
def sum_mult_five_three int
  sum = 0
  arr = (1..int).map{|x| x}
  arr.each do |x| 
    sum += x if x % 3 == 0 || x % 5 == 0
  end 
  sum
end

# ALTERNATIVE APPROACH
# def multiple?(number, divisor)
#   number % divisor == 0
# end

# def multisum(max_value)
#   sum = 0
#   1.upto(max_value) do |number|
#     if multiple?(number, 3) || multiple?(number, 5)
#       sum += number
