# In the modern era under the Gregorian Calendar, leap years occur in every year that is evenly divisible by 4, unless the year is also divisible by 100. If the year is evenly divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year unless the year is evenly divisible by 400.

  year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0 ? true : false
end
